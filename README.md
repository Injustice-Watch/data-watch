# data-watch
A node template for a Data Watch story.

<strong>We're assuming:</strong>

You have node installed on your machine. That's it, really! 

## Get Started

Navigate locally to your project's directory, and then run: 

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Injustice-Watch/data-watch/archive/master.tar.gz | tar -xz --strip-components=1
```

Next, 

```sh
npm install
```

## Development

```sh
gulp watch
```

## Production

```sh
gulp build
```
Go to the dist directory created in your project, and these are all the files you'll need to upload to the server!
